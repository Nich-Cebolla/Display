# Display
 An AutoHotkey (AHK) library that provides tools for managing windows and handling per-monitor dpi awareness.

This is mostly working, and the major functions are tested, but I have not tested every function. I welcome you to report any broken functions and I will fix them.

Known issues:

`Scrollbar` is nonfunctional.

This is a library-in-progress. Please check back regularly for updates.
